# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
- Breast cancer accounts that one woman is diagnosed every two minutes and every nine minutes, one woman dies. Early detection and diagnosis can save the lives of cancer patients. 
- Hence, I present a novel method to detect breast cancer by employing techniques of Machine Learning. 
The proposed method which used ANN model has produced highly accurate and efficient results when compared to the existing methods.
